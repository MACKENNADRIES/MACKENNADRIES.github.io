#  Mackenna_Dries - Portfolio Task
​
[My portfolio site](https://mackennadries.github.io/)
​
## Project Requirements
## The vibe/idea of my portfolio
 My goal for this portfolio was/is to make an 'interactive world', based off of my own garden. It was super challening but I had fun and learnt HEAPS (yay!)
### Content
 I have both a about me page and a projects page that are styled very similarly. 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
I knew that my portfolio was going to be quite complex and a bit of a challenge. Having so many pages that are different, I found I was creating so many css and html pages. I am trying to consolidate all duplicated css into the shared-styles.css folder. I know that there is some code that I can reduce and clean up, I will be working on this moving forward. Responsiveness is also something I need to put alot more time into. I knew this was going to be a huge challenge when making this style of site... 

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles. Explore page and Home page do this well. Still working on media queries for the others... 
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
If you can't tell.... i LOVE CSS animations lol. I have added a few different hover states, such as scale and brightness to draw the users attention to what I want them to click on. 
In an attempt to learn HTML, CSS and JS I have done a few 'game' tutorials, hence the memory card game, which I thought would be cute to incorporate into this. 

- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
